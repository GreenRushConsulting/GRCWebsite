                    <p>In April, 2021 Connecticut proposed SB 888, setting the framework to legalize adult use cannabis within the state.

If and when this bill is passed MJ Business Daily predicts that annual revenues can reach $725 Million by its fourth year.</p>

Ted Lemont renewed his call for marijuana legalization during his State of the State address. The bill would allow the possession and purchase of a maximum of one and a half ounces of marijuana from a licensed retailer. The bill, if passed, would allow businesses to be licensed to cultivate, manufacture, test, and sell cannabis, aligning with the recreational market. The bill was not passed, but is expected to be revisited in 2021. </p>
