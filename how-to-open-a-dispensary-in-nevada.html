            <h2>Nevada Marijuana Laws</h2>
            <p>The Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board recently released regulations regarding Cannabis Consumption Lounges and how to apply for a license to operate one of these establishments. The rules and regulations for applying for a Cannabis Consumption Lounge online can be found HERE. About 40-45 licenses will be issued to existing licensed retailers, and another 20 licenses will be issued for independent applicants who do not hold an existing retail operator license. Approximately 10 of those licenses will have discounted fees and given to social equity applicants.</p>
            <p>Nevada voters legalized the use of medical marijuana in 2000. In 2013, Senate Bill 374 was introduced to implement a regulated retail medical marijuana system. While 372 facilities received provisional certification under SB374 only 65 were authorized to operate by the end of 2016. In November, 2016, Nevada voters passed Question 2, authorizing the sales of recreational marijuana. Under the initiative, only existing licensees were eligible to conduct retail sales for the first 18 months of operations.</p>
            <p>The Department of Taxation is responsible for licensing and regulating retail marijuana businesses in Nevada and associated Nevada Marijuana Laws. As of July 1, 2017, the Department is also responsible for the state's medical marijuana program.</p>

            <p> Nevada Senate Bill 305 adopts the U.S. Farm Bill, Section 7606 regulations and imposes them within the state of Nevada.

        <h2>History of Marijuana in Nevada</h2>
        <p>In November 2000, 65% of Nevada voters approved ballot Question 9, which allowed the use of medical marijuana in Nevada and authorized home cultivation with a patient registry. Details are listed in Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 453A: Medical Use of Marijuana.</p>
        <p>In June 2013, Governor Sandoval signed Senate Bill 374 , authorizing licensed medical marijuana facilities for cultivation, production, dispensaries, and laboratories, and updated NRS 453A to allow for their regulation.</p>
        <p>The initial ten-day application period for medical marijuana facilities was August 5-18, 2014. Nevada received 519 applications, which by law had to be scored and ranked within 90 days. On November 3, 2014, Nevada granted provisional certificates to 182 cultivation, 118 production, 55 dispensary, and 17 independent testing facilities. The first received final certification and opened in March 2015. By the end of 2016, only 65 of the 372 facilities with provisional certificates had received final certification.</p>
        <p>In November 2016 Nevada voters passed Question 2 , authorizing the sales of recreational marijuana. For the first 18 months from the date that recreational dispensaries are allowed to open, only those with a medical marijuana license were allowed to own and operate recreational facilities. As with the medical framework, counties are legally allowed to ban recreational dispensaries. Some retailers were able to begin sales for recreational marijuana on July 1, 2017. Nevada accepted additional license applications in 2018. Green Rush Consulting submitted a winning application on behalf of a marijuana cultivator.</p>
