        <h2>New Mexico Marijuana History</h2>
        <p>In April 2007, Governor Bill Richardson signed into law Senate Bill 523, the Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act, allowing patients and caregivers access to medical marijuana with a physician’s recommendation, regulated by the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH). State licensed businesses may grow, process, transport, and dispense medical marijuana. </p>
        <p> On April 3, 2019, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signed SB 323 into law to decriminalize marijuana possession in New Mexico. Penalties for possession of up to a half-ounce of marijuana will be decreased to a $50 fine instead of jail time, treated as a penalty assessment misdemeanor and not considered a criminal conviction. The law went into effect July 1, 2019. </p>
        <p>On January 24, 2019, state Representative Javier Martínez introduced House Bill 356, also known as the Cannabis Regulation Act, to legalize recreational marijuana in New Mexico. The bill stalled in the Senate without a vote as the legislative session ended on March 16, 2019, effectively killing the bill. </p>
        <p>As of October 31st, the NMDOH Medical Cannabis Program had more than 78,000 patients.  New Mexico’s Medical Marijuana Program totaled $106 million in 2018. Under the current program design, the Medical Marijuana Program’s total industry revenues are projected to reach $131 million by the end of 2019. If the program allowed patients to fully access medical cannabis, the industry could achieve over $290 million in sales by the end of 2019.</p>
        <p>As of November 2019, legalization of recreational marijuana is said to lead to 11,000 jobs and bring in $54 million in tax revenue to the state. Licensed Non-Profit Producers (LNPP) application process is closed. NMDOH is not accepting applications from businesses interested in producing and distributing medical marijuana.</p>
        <p>New Mexico amended its hemp production laws on April 1, 2019, allowing for production, research, and manufacturing of hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) in the state.</p>
