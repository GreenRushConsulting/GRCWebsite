            <h2>Vermont Marijuana Laws</h2>
            <p>In 2004, the Vermont General Assembly passed S. 76, an act allowing for the medical use of marijuana. S.247- passed in 2014 - eliminates the cap of 1,000 patients who are allowed to access dispensaries. It also allows dispensaries to deliver medical marijuana to patients.  </p>

                <p>  On January 22, 2018, Governor Phil Scott signed H.B. 511, which legalized the recreational use of marijuana. The law makes it legal for adults 21 years and older to possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and have 2 mature marijuana plants or 4 immature plants in each dwelling unit.</p>

                <p>  On January 21, 2019, S.B. 54 was introduced to establish a system to tax and regulate the production and sale of marijuana through licensed recreational marijuana businesses. Adults 21 and older are allowed to possess, cultivate and consume marijuana in Vermont, but retail sales are currently prohibited. 
                
                SB 54, currently before the legislature, would establish a commercial cannabis system, impose a 10 percent excise tax on sales and shift regulatory responsibilities from the state Department of Public Health to an independent Cannabis Control Board.  The legislature is in recess until 2020. 
                
                If passed, licenses for retailers and marijuana will likely be issued in 2021.</p>

                <h2>Available License Types</h2>
                <p>The Department of Public Safety has currently issued 5 medical dispensary registration certificates. Adults 21 and older are allowed to possess, cultivate and consume recreational marijuana in Vermont, but retail sales are currently prohibited.</p>
                <p>Currently there is no application available.</p>
                
                <h2>Qualifying Conditions</h2>
                <p>The Vermont Marijuana Registry (VMR) is responsible for issuing medical cannabis cards to patients. Qualifying conditions include: </p>
