        <h2>New Hampshire Marijuana History</h2>
        <p>Passed in 2013, HB 573 allows patients with qualifying medical conditions to register with the state Department of Health and Human Services to possess up to 2 ounces of marijuana at a time, known as the Therapeutic Cannabis Program. The Department was also tasked with selecting 4 non-profit alternative treatment centers (ATCs) to grow and sell medical marijuana. In 2015, the department announced 3 selected applicants to operate the state’s first 3 ATC’s which are spread out throughout the state. As of June 30, 2019, there are currently four ATCs by region: Prime ATC (Merrimack), Sanctuary ATC (Plymouth), Temescal Wellness (Dover), and Temescal Wellness (Lebanon), serving 8,302 qualifying patients.The Therapeutic Cannabis Program 2019 Data Report published by the New Hampshire Department of Health outlines details for ATC expansion.</p>
        <p>The state assigned a Commission to Study the Legalization, Regulation, and Taxation of Marijuana in 2018 to research the possibility of legalizing marijuana in the state. The commission issued a report to the State Legislature with 54 specific recommendations for policymakers.</p>
        <p>In 2019, House Bill 481 was introduced to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. The bill would establish a Cannabis Control Commission to license and regulate marijuana businesses within the state. The bill stalled in the Senate and did not pass out of the legislature before adjournment of the 2019 legislative session.</p>
        <p>In the Therapeutic Cannabis Program 2019 Data Report the Therapeutic Cannabis Program seeks approval of second dispensary locations to be operated by the licensed ATC serving qualifying patients in Region 1 and the licensed ATC serving qualifying patients in Region 2.</p>
        <h3>CBD</h3>
        <p>The N.H. Department of Health and Human Services has reminded cities and towns that CBD is not approved for use in food products. In a written statement, the department says, per FDA regulations: “CBD is not a permitted additive in the state. This guidance has also been issued to self-inspecting municipalities to follow those regulations.”</p>

        <p>The state passed House Bill 459, which allows for the growth of hemp in New Hampshire. Governor Chris Sununu signed the bill into law on July 30, 2019. The bill also established a study committee to study the federal guidelines on growing hemp. </p>
