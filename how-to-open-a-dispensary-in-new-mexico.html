        <h2>New Mexico Marijuana History</h2>
        <p>In April 2007, Governor Bill Richardson signed into law Senate Bill 523, the Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act, allowing patients and caregivers access to medical marijuana with a physicianâ€™s recommendation, regulated by the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH). State licensed businesses may grow, process, transport, and dispense medical marijuana. </p>
        <p> On April 3, 2019, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signed SB 323 into law to decriminalize marijuana possession in New Mexico. Penalties for possession of up to a half-ounce of marijuana will be decreased to a $50 fine instead of jail time, treated as a penalty assessment misdemeanor and not considered a criminal conviction. The law went into effect July 1, 2019. </p>
        <p>On January 24, 2019, state Representative Javier MartÃ­nez introduced House Bill 356, also known as the Cannabis Regulation Act, to legalize recreational marijuana in New Mexico. The bill stalled in the Senate without a vote as the legislative session ended on March 16, 2019, effectively killing the bill. </p>
        <p>As of October 31st, the NMDOH Medical Cannabis Program had more than 78,000 patients.  New Mexicoâ€™s Medical Marijuana Program totaled $106 million in 2018. Under the current program design, the Medical Marijuana Programâ€™s total industry revenues are projected to reach $131 million by the end of 2019. If the program allowed patients to fully access medical cannabis, the industry could achieve over $290 million in sales by the end of 2019.</p>
        <p>As of November 2019, legalization of recreational marijuana is said to lead to 11,000 jobs and bring in $54 million in tax revenue to the state. Licensed Non-Profit Producers (LNPP) application process is closed. NMDOH is not accepting applications from businesses interested in producing and distributing medical marijuana.</p>
        <p>New Mexico amended its hemp production laws on April 1, 2019, allowing for production, research, and manufacturing of hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) in the state.</p>
