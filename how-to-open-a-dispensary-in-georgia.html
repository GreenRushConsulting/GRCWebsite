            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In April 2019, Gov. Brian Kemp signed House Bill 324 to provide patients who were already allowed to possess low-THC, high-CBD marijuana oil a legal way to access the product. The new law will establish a state-regulated dispensing system of licensed marijuana producers.</p>
            <p>Government officials appointed members to the Georgia Access to Medical Cannabis Commission on November 12, 2019. The formation of the commission will now allow for the drafting of regulations to license, establish and regulate medical cannabis businesses. Regulating Department in Georgia is the Department of Public Health.</p>
            <p> In December 2022, the commission submitted its final report and recommendations for establishing a state-regulating dispensing system to improve patient access to low THC medical cannabis oil they qualify for. Among its recommendations, the report proposes to allow 10 grow licenses, 10 manufacturing licenses and an “adequate number” of dispensing licenses.</p>
            <p>  Starting October 4th of 2023, Independent pharmacies will be able to sell medicinal cannabis. This approach to medicinal cannabis is the first in the United States to do so and according to the associated press, "About 90% of Georgia's population will be within a 30-minute drive of a pharmacy selling medical marijuana when they open". To actually get cannabis from the pharmacy you must be registered with Georgia's Low THC registry.</p>
            <h2>Application Fees/Start up costs</h2>
            <p>Class 1 Production License requires a non-refundable application fee of $25,000, an initial license fee of $200,000 and license renewal fee of $100,000.</p>
            <p>Class 2 Production License requires a non-refundable application fee of $5,000, an initial license fee of $100,000 and license renewal fee of $50,000.</p>
            <p>Low-THC dispensing facilities are required to pay a licensing fee of anywhere from $5,000 - $30,000 depending on the tier in the county, with a annual fee of anywhere between $25,000 - $40,000 per tier.</p>
            <h2>Dispensing License</h2>
            <p>Georgia's Dispensing License is directly correlated to the number of registered patients seeking medical treatment. This license allows for the dispensing of low-THC oil and is issued in increments of every 10,000 patients added to the registry. Each licensee can obtain up to six licenses for dispensing locations. In the future, the Georgia Access to Medical Cannabis Commission plans to introduce more licenses to accommodate the growing market. For detailed information and the application form, visit the GA Access to Medical Cannabis Commission's Dispensing License page.</p>
            
            <h3>Important Dates</h3>
            <p>Government officials appointed members to the Georgia Access to Medical Cannabis Commission on November 12, 2019. The formation of the commission will now allow for the drafting of regulations to license, establish and regulate medical marijuana businesses. regulated by the Department of Public Health.</p>
            <p>The state is expected to issue a “Request for Applications” (RFA) for medical marijuana cultivation licenses before the end of 2019. In this first round, up to 6 cultivation licenses will be awarded to private companies seeking to grow medical marijuana in Georgia. We Ot is anticipated that the Georgia Access to Medical Cannabis Commission may begin applications for medical marijuana dispensaries in 2020.</p>
